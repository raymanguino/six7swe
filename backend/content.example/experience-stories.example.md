# Experience stories (example)

Use this file to capture a few high‑impact stories you can reuse in interviews, portfolio content, and AI-assisted tooling. Aim for 2–4 stories that cover different themes (impact, leadership, failure/learning, ambiguity, etc.).

## Revenue or business impact story

Describe a project where your work had a clear business outcome (revenue, cost savings, risk reduction, latency/SLAs, etc.).

Suggested structure:

- **Context:** Where you worked, rough team size, and what problem the business was facing.
- **Challenge:** Why this was hard (technical, organizational, regulatory, time pressure, etc.).
- **Actions:** What you personally did (architecture decisions, coding, coordination, unblockers).
- **Result:** Concrete impact, ideally with numbers (e.g. revenue, performance gains, reliability, adoption).
- **Takeaways:** 1–2 things you learned or would highlight to a hiring manager.

## Failure / learning story

Describe a time something went wrong in production or during a major initiative, and what you learned from it.

Suggested structure:

- **Context:** System, team, and stakes.
- **The mistake:** What you changed or missed, and why it seemed reasonable at the time.
- **Impact:** What broke, how users or the business were affected.
- **Recovery:** How you fixed it and improved safety (tests, processes, observability, playbooks).
- **Learning:** What you changed about how you work going forward.

## Additional stories (optional)

You can add one or more sections like these:

- **Leading without authority** – driving a cross-team project or change.
- **Shipping under ambiguity** – clarifying a vague problem and landing a solution.
- **Technical deep dive** – a complex performance, security, or architecture problem you solved.

Feel free to duplicate this template and rename headings to fit your own experiences.

# Leadership experience

Ray has led technical initiatives and cross-functional work across Tanium, Nacelle, Capital One, and IBM:

- **Technical leadership:** Drove architecture decisions and mentored engineers on best practices. Led migration and cleanup of legacy APIs and data pipelines. At Tanium, led design and development of new external GraphQL APIs that replaced fragmented REST endpoints; drove cross-functional alignment on long-term API strategy, documentation standards, schema governance, and monitoring. At Nacelle, defined technical direction for the GraphQL schema registry, coordinated delivery across backend and QA teams, and oversaw schema ingestion logic and API generation. At IBM, led design and development of data ETL functions and REST API endpoints for the core business management application.

- **Stakeholder alignment:** Worked with product and business to prioritize work that reduced revenue loss and improved system reliability. Aligned with stakeholders on milestones and success metrics; presented roadmaps and risk analyses to leadership; represented backend team in broader engineering discussions and managed expectations with technical and non-technical partners.

- **Series B / startup fit:** Comfortable in fast-moving environments with messy APIs and data infrastructure. Has experience turning around technical debt, improving data quality and API consistency, and delivering high-impact systems under ambiguity (e.g., Nacelle schema registry—evaluated sync vs async design based on data, shipped synchronous first with monitoring to scale later).

- **Mentoring and conflict resolution:** At Tanium, navigated a code refactor with a junior engineer; explained pitfalls of the existing approach and worked together on an object hierarchy that was easier to extend and maintain. At Nacelle, resolved an architecture debate with senior engineers about synchronous vs Kafka-based design by implementing monitoring and using data to show the simpler design was sufficient, with follow-up tickets for future scaling.

## Revenue impact (~$20M/year)

Ray contributed to initiatives that recovered significant lost revenue. The work involved both technical and organizational changes:

- **Technical:** Identifying and fixing data pipeline gaps, reconciliation issues, and system reliability problems that were causing revenue leakage.
- **Political / process:** Aligning teams on priorities, establishing SLAs, and improving visibility so revenue-impacting issues were detected and fixed quickly.

Replace with your actual story: what you built, what you changed, and how much was recovered.

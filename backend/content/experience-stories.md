# Experience stories

## Revenue impact (~$20M/year)

Ray led the engineering effort at Capital One to deliver a new credit card launch platform for the Canadian business by inner-sourcing changes into a U.S.-owned system under strict regulatory deadlines. Missing the deadline would have resulted in the inability to offer a new card that accounted for approximately **$20 million in annual revenue**. The system was owned by U.S. teams who were fully allocated to a major migration; Canada was low priority. Ray took ownership on the Canadian side: built relationships with U.S. leadership and engineering, gained access to their codebase and processes, and led a team of three engineers and two process managers through planning and delivery. He architected the pathway to onboard Canadian credit card solicitations onto the existing U.S. platform, contributed to modernizing solicitation workflows, implemented Golang backend logic to map Canadian business intent to customer profiles, and led development of the React front-end component library (with a hackathon POC that became the production UI). The platform launched on time, met compliance deadlines, and unlocked around **$20 million in annual revenue**. The work involved both **technical** (architecture, Go/React implementation, CI/CD, observability) and **political/process** (executive alignment, cross-country coordination, inner-sourcing approval, joining U.S. scrums).

## Biggest failure

At Nacelle, Ray addressed intermittent slow queries in the auth service by investigating and determining the cause: middleware was making inefficient queries similar to N+1. He refactored the code to use joins instead. The refactor caused a **high-severity production incident** that prevented admins from accessing their space; the failure mode was not covered by unit or integration tests. After the incident, he added tests to cover it, started conversations with broader Engineering about use of Sequelize (the team had negative views), and got agreement to phase out Sequelize in favor of manual query writing—PRs moving forward would remove Sequelize from updated files. **What he learned:** Be more cautious reusing tools without fully understanding them, even when it's "just" a refactor. The experience reinforced the importance of test coverage for refactors and led to removing unneeded ORM cognitive overhead and improving stability across the codebase.
